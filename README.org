A small library for generating names.  Like [[https://github.com/eigenhombre/namejen][this Clojure library]] but
simpler and much faster.

** API

All functions return strings unless noted otherwise.
| =(trad-name)=         | Pick a name at random                            |
| =(ngram-name)=        | Pick a common n-gram; /n/ one of (2 3 4)         |
| =(single-name)=       | Either of the previous two                       |
| =(full-name-as-list)= | A list of single names -- usually 2 or 3 of them |
| =(full-name-as-str)=  | Same as above, but as a string with spaces       |
